                <h3>Raga</h3>
                <p>Raga is the melodic framework of notes, arranged to create different and varying melodies that evoke various Bhava (emotional expressions) and rasa (feelings) in both the listener and the player. Each raga follows its own set of rules based on the arrangement of notes (swarams) and their positions within the scale (swarasthanam): </p>

                <p>Different swarasthanams in different combinations form the 72 Melakarta ragas of Carnatic music. The nomenclature of these ragas is in itself an acute usage of mathematics - which we will not be dealing with but you can find it <a href="https://lvnaga.wordpress.com/2015/11/26/melakartha-chart-scales-of-carnatic-music/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p> Ragas are not just a series of notes; they have their own unique movements, called gamakas. These gamakas are the key to unlocking the emotional essence of a raga. As aspiring musicians, we need to pay attention to every nuance of the ragas we learn. Which notes should be adorned with gamakas, which ones should remain plain, and how to glide seamlessly from one note to another – it's like a delicate dance of emotions. It takes practice, patience, and a pinch of passion to master this art of expressing emotions through music.</p>

                <h3>Rasa</h3>
                    <p>Rasa, or aesthetic enjoyment, is experienced through a blend of the sthāyibhāva (the main, lasting emotional mood) with other elements: the vibhāvas (the objects of emotion, like a hero or heroine, as well as things that spark emotions, such as springtime, flowers, moonlight, and romantic settings), anubhāvas (visible expressions of emotions, like raising eyebrows, glances, and smiles), and vyabhicāribhāvas (temporary moods that come and go, supporting the creation of rasa).</p>
                    <P>According to Bharata, there are eight primary emotional moods, or sthāyibhāvas, that a dramatic performance can elevate into a state of aesthetic pleasure. These are rati (love), hāsa (laughter), śōka (sorrow), krōdha (anger), utsāha (energy), bhaya (fear), jugupsā (disgust), and vismaya (wonder). Each of these moods corresponds to a specific rasa: śṛṅgāra (love), hāsya (humor), karuṇa (compassion), raudra (anger), vīra (heroism), bhayānaka (fear), bībatsa (disgust), and adbhuta (wonder). Later scholars introduced a ninth rasa, śānta, linked to the mood of nirvēda (detachment).</p>            
                    <p>The concept of rasa is that, while the aesthetic pleasure we get from art or literature is fundamentally the same, the variety of rasa comes from the differences in these primary emotional moods, or sthāyibhāvas. Ultimately, rasa is a single, pleasurable feeling produced in the audience that transforms the emotional states portrayed into a unified experience of enjoyment.</p>
